    <h1>Juicy Roasted Chicken</h1>
    <img src="image_3.jpg" alt="Juicy Roasted Chicken" width="200px" height="200px" style="object-fit:cover ;">
    <p>My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's funny. We nibble on the celery after.</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup margarine, divided</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Step I</li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</p>
        <li>Step II</li>
        <p>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</p>
        <li>Step III</li>
        <p>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</p>
